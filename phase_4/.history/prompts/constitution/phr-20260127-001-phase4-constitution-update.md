# Phase 4 Constitution Update

## Original Prompt
Create a Constitution file for my Hackathon Phase 4: Local Kubernetes Deployment of Todo Chatbot. Use Spec-Driven Development (SDD-RI) style from previous phases. Project context: Phase 3 is complete (Todo AI Chatbot with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, Neon DB, OpenAI agent, MCP tools). Phase 4 objective: Containerize frontend/backend, use Gordon for Docker, create Helm charts with kubectl-ai/kagent, deploy on Minikube locally. Constitution should include: Quality standards: Scalable, resilient, zero-cost local setup, AI-assisted ops. Key principles: Stateless server, horizontal scaling, testability. Success metrics: Deployment works on Minikube, pods running, services accessible, AI tools used. Non-goals: No cloud deployment, no advanced CI/CD. Output as Markdown file: specs/todo-project/phase4-constitution.md

## Response Summary
Updated the project constitution from version 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 to include Phase IV Local Kubernetes Deployment principles. Added new core principles covering containerization standards, Helm chart management, Minikube deployment, AI-assisted operations, zero-cost local setup, horizontal scaling requirements, and resilient architecture. Updated coding standards to include Kubernetes configuration guidelines. Modified non-goals to explicitly exclude cloud deployment and advanced CI/CD pipelines. Maintained all existing constitutional principles from previous phases.
