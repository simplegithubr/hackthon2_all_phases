# Phase 4 Plan Creation

## Original Prompt
Create a Plan file for Phase 4: Local Kubernetes Deployment. SDD-RI workflow. Based on spec: [Paste Phase IV document] Plan: - Step 1: Containerization with Gordon - Step 2: Minikube setup - Step 3: Helm charts with kubectl-ai - Step 4: Deployment and scaling with kagent - Alternatives if AI tools unavailable Output as Markdown: specs/todo-project/phase4-plan.md

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Local Kubernetes Deployment phase. The plan includes technical context, constitution check, gates validation, research tasks, design & architecture, and implementation steps. The plan follows the required steps: containerization with Gordon, Minikube setup, Helm charts with kubectl-ai, and deployment/scaling with kagent. Alternative approaches are included if AI tools are unavailable.

## Key Elements
- Four main implementation steps: containerization, minikube setup, helm charts, deployment/scaling
- Research tasks addressing containerization strategy, helm generation, resource requirements
- Design elements covering kubernetes resources, helm chart structure, containerization
- Constitution check confirming all principles are satisfied
- Gates validation for feasibility, compatibility, and alignment
- Alternative approaches if AI tools are unavailable
