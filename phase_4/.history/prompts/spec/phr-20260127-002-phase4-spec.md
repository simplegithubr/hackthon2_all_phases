# Phase 4 Spec Creation

## Original Prompt
Create a Specification file for my Hackathon Phase 4: Local Kubernetes Deployment. Follow SDD-RI workflow. Context: Phase 3 Todo AI Chatbot is complete (FastAPI + Next.js + Neon DB + OpenAI agent). Phase 4 from document: [Paste the full Phase IV document here from your message] Spec structure: - Intent: Deploy chatbot on local K8s with Minikube, Helm, AI tools - Constraints: Use Gordon for containerization, kubectl-ai/kagent for charts/ops, Minikube local - Success Evals: Pods running, services exposed, scalable, AI-assisted - Non-goals: No production cloud, no extra features - Edge cases: If Gordon unavailable, use standard Docker CLI

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive specification for the Local Kubernetes Deployment phase. The spec includes user stories for deploying the Todo Chatbot on local Kubernetes, scaling the application, and using AI-assisted operations. Functional requirements cover containerization with Gordon, Helm chart generation with kubectl-ai, deployment to Minikube, and maintaining existing functionality. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.

## Key Elements
- User stories prioritized (P1-P3) covering deployment, scaling, and AI operations
- 10 functional requirements covering containerization, deployment, and scalability
- 4 key entities identified (Kubernetes Deployment, Helm Chart, Minikube Cluster, Docker Image)
- 6 measurable success criteria focusing on deployment success and functionality
- Edge cases for tool unavailability and resource constraints
