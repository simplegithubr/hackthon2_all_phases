# Phase 4 Tasks Breakdown

## Original Prompt
Create Tasks breakdown for Phase 4 Plan. Break into atomic units. Tasks for: - Install tools (Docker, Minikube, Helm, AI agents) - Build Dockerfiles - Generate charts - Deploy and test - Validate scalability Output as list in Markdown: specs/todo-project/phase4-tasks.md

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive breakdown of tasks for Phase 4: Local Kubernetes Deployment with 8 sprints and 27 atomic tasks. The tasks cover all required areas: environment setup and tool installation, containerization, Helm chart generation, deployment and configuration, testing and validation, scaling and optimization, resilience and health checks, and documentation. Each task includes description, acceptance criteria, dependencies, effort estimate, and priority level.

## Key Elements
- 8 sprints covering the full deployment lifecycle
- 27 atomic tasks with clear definitions
- Proper dependency mapping between tasks
- Effort and priority estimates for each task
- Coverage of all requested areas: tools, dockerfiles, charts, deployment, testing, scalability
- Contingency tasks for fallback scenarios when AI tools are unavailable
